# EasyDiffraction project

Launching point for the EasyDiffraction family of repositories

This repository is just a document with links to other repositories, which constitute the building blocks of the [EasyDiffraction](https://easydiffraction.org) project, part of the larger [EasyScience](https://easyscience.software) framework.
This ecosystem is divided into source code repositories, documentation repositories, and dependent project repositories to help both developers and end-users interact with our tools.

## Source code

[EasyDiffractionApp](https://github.com/easyScience/easyDiffractionApp) - This is the main application repository containing all the finalized, production-ready code.   
[EasyDiffractionBeta](https://github.com/easyScience/EasyDiffractionBeta) - This repository contains the beta version of the application, mainly for testing new features and implementations.  
[EasyDiffractionLib](https://github.com/easyScience/easyDiffractionLib) - This repository contains the core library accessible through the Jupyter Notebook/Python.  

## Documentation

[EasyDiffractionWww](https://github.com/easyScience/EasyDiffractionWww) - This is the documentation and content for the EasyDiffraction website.  
[EasyDiffractionAppDocs](https://github.com/easyScience/EasyDiffractionAppDocs) -  Comprehensive documentation detailing the usage, installation, and guides for EasyDiffractionApp.  
[EasyDiffractionLibDocs](https://github.com/easyScience/EasyDiffractionLibDocs) - Documentation for the EasyDiffractionLib, detailing API references, architectural design, and more.  

## Main dependencies

[EasyApp](https://github.com/easyScience/easyApp) - Application skeleton for the EasyScience framework, written in QML.  
[EasyCrystallography](https://github.com/easyScience/easyCrystallography) - Library for the generation and manipulation of crystal structures.
