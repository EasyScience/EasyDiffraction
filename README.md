**EasyDiffraction** is a software tool for calculating powder diffraction patterns based on structural models and refining their parameters against experimental data.

## **Distribution**

**EasyDiffraction** is available in two forms:
- ðŸ’» [EasyDiffraction Application] â€“ A cross-platform desktop application.
- ðŸ“¦ [EasyDiffraction Library] â€“ A Python library designed for use in scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

## **About This Repository**
This repository serves as the **central hub** for the EasyDiffraction family of repositories and provides:
- The source for the **project landing page** [http://easydiffraction.org](http://easydiffraction.org).
- A place for [Discussions] relevant to both the ðŸ’» [EasyDiffraction Application] and ðŸ“¦ [EasyDiffraction Library].

## **Main Dependencies**
- [EasyScience] â€“ Core building blocks for Python libraries in the EasyScience ecosystem.
- [EasyCrystallography] â€“ Backend crystallographic tools for structure analysis.
- [EasyApp] â€“ GUI components for building scientific desktop applications.
