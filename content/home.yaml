  title: Making _diffraction_ data analysis and modelling _easy_
  description: >-
    An intuitive and user-friendly application which integrates some
    crystallographic libraries such as
    [CrysPy](https://github.com/ikibalin/cryspy) and
    [CrysFML](https://code.ill.fr/scientific-software/crysfml) (experimental).
    Allowing for the simulation of diffraction patterns based on structural
    models and refinement against experimental data.
